/*
 * A Dot product of two vectors is a scalar which is a result of the sum of 
 * the product of each of the two vectorsâ€™ members. For example, if we have 
 * the vector [a 1 , a 2 ... a n ] and the vector [b 1 , b 2 ... b n ], their 
 * dot product is:
 * (a 1 b 1 + a 2 b 2 ... + a n b n ). You are given the length n of each of 
 * the vectors on the first input line (In order to perform a dot product of 
 * two vectors, they have to be with equal dimensions). On the next n lines, 
 * you are given the members of the first vector, and on the next n ones, 
 * the members of the second one.
