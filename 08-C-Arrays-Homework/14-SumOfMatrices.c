/*
 * You are given two matrices and you have to output a new matrix which is 
 * their sum. The sum of matrices is calculated by adding each of the members 
 * from the first matrix with each of the members of the second one and 
 * producing a number which is a member of a new matrix and is stationed in 
 * the same row and col. Write a program to calculate the sum of two matrices. 
 * On the first 2 lines, you are given the dimensions of the two matrices 
 * (In order for them to be added together, they must be of the same 
 * dimensions). The first line represents the rows of the matrices and the 
 * second one â€“ the columns. On the next input lines, you are given the 
 * members of the matrices.
